This is my own personal replacement for steamtinkerlaunch. steamtinkerlaunch is good but it ended up being too slow for me.
If you decide to use it, hope it works well for you.

Features:
-Change the EXE used to run a proton game on steam
-Set temporary or "permanent" exe (TODO)
-Allow selection of proton version (TODO)
-Install some special tools like optiscaler (Possibility, not sure about this yet)

Requirements to build:
    qt6-qtbase-devel (Fedora or distro equivalent)
